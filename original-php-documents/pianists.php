		<h2>Pianists</h2>
		<section class="summary-left">
			<p>Who are the greatest pianists who've ever lived? That's the question we put to the Classic FM presenters and – after much heated debate – these are my most favorite artists. Mozart could be considered the first "concert pianist" as he performed widely on the piano. Composers Beethoven and Clementi from the classical era were also famed for their playing, as were, from the romantic era, Liszt, Brahms, Chopin, Mendelssohn and Rachmaninoff. From that era, leading performers less known as composers were Clara Schumann and Hans von Bülow. However, as we do not have modern audio recordings of most of these pianists, we rely mainly on written commentary to give us an account of their technique and style.</p>

<h3>Glenn Gould (1932-1982)</h3>
<h4>Early years</h4>
<p>Glenn is a Canadian. Glenn Herbert Gould was born at home in Toronto on 25 September 1932, to Russell Herbert Gold (1901–1996) and Florence Emma Gold (née Greig; 1891–1975), Presbyterians of Scottish and English ancestry. His maternal grandfather was a cousin of Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg (who was himself of Scottish ancestry). The family's surname was changed to Gould informally around 1939 in order to avoid being mistaken for Jewish, given the prevailing anti-Semitism of prewar Toronto and the Gold surname's Jewish association.</p>

<li>A Merry Thought</li>
<li>Our Gifts, for voice & piano</li>
<li>Rondo in D major, piano</li>
